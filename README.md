# Human-Emotion-Image-Classifier-using-Deep-CNN üòÅüò¢

Emotion classification can be divided into two classes, primary emotion such as joy, sadness, anger, fear disgust, and surprise, and secondary emotion, which evokes a mental image that correlates to memory or primary emotion.

Positive emotions can be categorized as happiness or surprise, while negative emotions can be associated with sadness, anger, fear, and disgust.

## What is a CNN?

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet) is a deep learning algorithm specifically designed for any task where object recognition is crucial such as image classification, detection, and segmentation.  Many real-life applications, such as self-driving cars, surveillance cameras, and more, use CNNs.
